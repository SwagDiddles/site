      <h2>Values</h2>
      <p>I value timely delivery, accuracy, and reliability. As a Developer, it goes without saying that the user wants the product at their fingertips as soon as possible. In order to meet deadlines, I keep clear track of my time and how to jump
        from one task to another as well as the order to accomplish tasks. This leads into accuracy. In order to be accurate, it is important that I lay out a schedule with soft deadlines and allowing myself time to go back to catch any errors. The
        product is for the user and you must cater it to their needs/desires. Last, reliability. More than anything, I wish to serve as a reliable developer who exceeds expectations, accepts and is open to criticism, and is constantly looking for
        more avenues to grow. Not only am I to be held reliable, but the product I will be providing to users as well.</p>

      <h2>Free Time</h2>
      <p>I currently run two podcasts on my free time. The first being /allchat with my two current roommates, Adam and Taren. This one stems from a MOBA widely known as League of Legends, specifically surrounding the competitive scene here in North
        America. We cover games played for each given weekend, roster rumors, and evaluate team performances (power rankings). </p>
      <p>Green Town is the other project I lead with two friends from my hometown, Jesse and Juan. We describe this podcast as “about nothing and everything” since it is mainly just us rambling about current events and other topics which make us
        happy. Each week, we have a new guest join us to indulge in conversation and provide their insight on topics like technology, music, and most recently, quarantine. This project came to life recently but has been the most fun. The process of
        editing, managing social media, and sourcing for
        guests has been interesting and allows for a different dynamic.</p>
