      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>&emsp;Hello! My name is Angel Arizmendi, a Latino from Waukegan, IL. My undergraduate studies were completed at the University of Iowa from August 20016 to May 2020. I have a degree in Informatics with an emphasis in Human Computer
        Interaction and a certificate in Arts Entrepreneurship. My time in Iowa City was fun, productive, and full of memories. I am looking to shift my focus toward Front-End Development and am willing to relocate.</p>

    <div class="child2">
      <h2>Values</h2>
      <p>&emsp;I value timely delivery, accuracy, and reliability. As a Developer, it goes without saying that the user wants the product at their fingertips as soon as possible. In order to meet deadlines, I keep clear track of my time and how to
        jump
        from one task to another as well as the order to accomplish tasks. This leads into accuracy. In order to be accurate, it is important that I lay out a schedule with soft deadlines and allowing myself time to go back to catch any errors. The
        product is for the user and you must cater it to their needs/desires. Last, reliability. More than anything, I wish to serve as a reliable developer who exceeds expectations, accepts and is open to criticism, and is constantly looking for
        more avenues to grow. Not only am I to be held reliable, but the product I will be providing to users as well.</p>

      <h2>Prior Experience</h2>
      <div class="job1">
        <h3 id="dec">Overnight Security</h3>
        <h3 id="dec">University of Iowa Department of Public Safety</h3>
        <p>&emsp;My job offers a variety of different shifts. For example, there are Hawk Lot shifts where I monitor the commuter parking lot where students can leave their cars for long periods of time. Every hour, I go out on rounds to check every
          aisle of the lot. One of my other permanent shifts is Nite Ride Ops where I operate the Nite Ride desk, answer phone calls made by students who need a ride late at night and enter their information into our system which sends the
          information out to one of our 6 drivers for that given night. Other shifts include Overnight Dorms (monitor and check residence halls), Fire Watch (patrol sections of the University Hospital which are under construction and check for fire
          and safety regulations), and Unlocks (quick shift which requires walking to every main building on campus and unlocking main entrances early in the morning)</p>
      </div>

      <div class="job2">
        <h3 id="dec">SCOPE Productions</h3>
        <h3 id="dec">Production Director</h3>
        <p>&emsp;SCOPE is a production company on campus which brings live acts and artists to the University of Iowa! My position in this student organization is Production Director. I oversee reservations for EMTs (w/ an Ambulance), Front of Stage
          Security, and Uniformed Police Officers. I maintain professional contact with these three companies and keep them up to date on when we will be having our event, the timeframe they will be working/on standby, and the approximate turnout for
          the event. Some more tasks for this position include drawing up security maps on a ground plan of the given venue, run weekly meetings with my Production committee, and filling out paperwork for vehicles we will be using day-of-show.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="job3">
        <h3 id="dec">St. Benedict Technology Consortium</h3>
        <h3 id="dec">Intern</h3>
        <p>&emsp;During my time with SBTC, I got to help in a variety of their departments. I was able to assist with tech support, their help desk which took tickets and helped troubleshoot problems schools under our system were running into, and
          went out to a school to help set up chrome books for an elementary school!</p>

        <h2>Free Time</h2>
        <p>&emsp;I currently run two podcasts on my free time. The first being /allchat with my two current roommates, Adam and Taren. This one stems from a MOBA widely known as League of Legends, specifically surrounding the competitive scene here
          in North
          America. We cover games played for each given weekend, roster rumors, and evaluate team performances (power rankings).<br />&emsp;Green Town is the other project I lead with two friends from my hometown, Jesse and Juan. We describe this
          podcast as “about nothing and everything” since it is mainly just us rambling about current events and other topics which make us
          happy. Each week, we have a new guest join us to indulge in conversation and provide their insight on topics like technology, music, and most recently, quarantine. This project came to life recently but has been the most fun. The process of
          editing, managing social media, and sourcing for
          guests has been interesting and allows for a different dynamic.</p>
